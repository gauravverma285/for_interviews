# Python Lambda Functions are anonymous functions means that the function is without a name. 
# As we already know the def keyword is used to define a normal function in Python. Similarly, 
# the lambda keyword is used to define an anonymous function in Python.



# Syntax: lambda arguments : expression

# This function can have any number of arguments but only one expression, which is evaluated and returned.
# One is free to use lambda functions wherever function objects are required.
# You need to keep in your knowledge that lambda functions are syntactically restricted to a single expression.
# It has various uses in particular fields of programming, besides other types of expressions in functions.

# Example

        # str1 = 'GeeksforGeeks'

        # upper = lambda string: string.upper()
        # print(upper(str1))
